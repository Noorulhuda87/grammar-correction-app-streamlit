# üìù Grammar Correction App by Noorulhuda

This is a simple, clean, and powerful AI-powered grammar correction web application developed using Python and Streamlit. The app leverages OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3.5 model to instantly correct grammar in English sentences or paragraphs. Designed for clarity and ease of use, this project demonstrates how advanced language models can be integrated into accessible user interfaces.

Key Features:
- Real-time grammar correction using GPT-3.5 Turbo
- Clean and intuitive user interface built with Streamlit
- Secure API key handling using Streamlit Secrets Manager
- Responsive layout suitable for desktop and mobile
- Perfect for students, writers, educators, and anyone looking to improve written English

How it works:
Users enter a sentence or paragraph into a text box and click "Correct Grammar." The app sends the text to OpenAI‚Äôs model via their official Python SDK. The model returns a grammatically corrected version of the text, which is then displayed in a second text area for easy comparison or copying.
